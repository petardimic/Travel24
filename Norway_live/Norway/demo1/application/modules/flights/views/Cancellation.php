Below we describe two types   of cookies:    Session cookies: These are used to maintain something called session   state and only last for the duration of users using the Website. A   session cookie expires when a user closes his/her browser, or if a user   has not visited the server for a certain period of time i.e. if you   consider your journey through the site to be a conversation with us,   this cookie reminds the site where we were in that conversation (for   instance if at some point in the conversation you asked us to add a   hotel to your basket, next time you click on the basket it will still be   there). These are required for the site to function effectively but are   not used in any way to identify you personally.</td>
